This rapid radiation may be linked to the diversity in behaviors, sexual selection, and phenotypic plasticity. To determine the relationships between morphology and behaviors, microcomputed tomography (microCT) was used to observe internal morphological structures. Observed morphological adaptations were linked with observed behavior of cichlids in Lake Malaŵi with respect to the various available food resources. Many of these adaptations have parallels, sometimes into the finest details, in other drainage systems and can thus be considered as variations of how cichlids in general respond to environmental opportunities and challenges. Variations in the structure and teeth of the pharyngeal jaws and the oral jaws allowed for fine tuning of specializations, so that various species can utilize the same source without direct competition. We suggested that high‐resolution X‐ray computed tomography will permit scientists to infer life history and behavior characters of rare or extinct taxa from a detailed examination of morphology and linkages between morphology and behavior found in extant species.</jats:p>",

Here, we use CT-imaging and 3D geometric morphometrics to quantify disparity in craniofacial morphologies, and to test the hypothesis of convergent skull-shape evolution in a phylogenetic context. For this study, we examined 391 specimens representing 78 species of Apteronotidae and Mormyridae including 30 of 37 (81%) of all valid genera with the goal to sample most of the craniofacial disparity known in these clades. We found no overlap between Apteronotidae and Mormyridae in the skull-shape morphospace using PCA and a common landmark scheme, and therefore no instances of complete phenotypic convergence. Instead, we found multiple potential instances of incomplete convergence, and at least one parallel shift among electric fish clades. The greatest components of shape variance in both families are the same as observed for most vertebrate clades: heterocephaly (i.e., opposite changes in relative sizes of the snout and braincase regions of the skull), and heterorhynchy (i.e., dorsoventral changes in relative snout flexion and mouth position). Mormyrid species examined here exhibit less craniofacial disparity than do apteronotids, potentially due to constraints associated with a larger brain size, ecological constraints related to food-type availability. Patterns of craniofacial evolution in these two clades depict a complex story of phenotypic divergence and convergence in which certain superficial similarities of external morphology obscure deeper osteological and presumably developmental differences of skull form and function. Among apteronotid and mormyrid electric fishes, craniofacial convergence is only skin deep.</jats:p>",

Despite the benefits associated with these newer imaging techniques, there remains a need for more “traditional” methods of morphological examination in many comparative studies. In this paper, we describe the costs and benefits of the various methods of visualizing, examining, and comparing morphological structures. There are significant differences not only in the costs associated with these different methods (monetary, time, equipment, and software), but also in the degree to which specimens are destroyed. We argue not for any one particular method over another in morphological studies, but instead suggest a combination of methods is useful not only for breadth of visualization, but also for the financial and time constraints often imposed on early-career research scientists.</jats:p>",

The past few years have seen major advances in the phylogenetics, evolutionary biogeography and ecology of cichlid fish. Most of this work has concentrated on the most diverse radiations. Unfortunately, a large number of small radiations and ‘non-radiations’ have been overlooked, potentially limiting the contribution of the cichlid system to our understanding of speciation and adaptive radiation. I have reviewed the literature to identify 33 intralacustrine radiations and 76 failed radiations. For as many as possible I collected information on lake size, age and phylogenetic relationships. I use these data to address two questions: (i) whether the rate of speciation and the resulting species richness are related to temporal and spatial variation in ecological opportunity and (ii) whether the likelihood of undergoing adaptive radiation is similar for different African cichlid lineages. The former is a key prediction of the ecological theory of adaptive radiation that has been presumed true but remains untested for cichlid radiations. The second is based on the hypothesis that the propensity of cichlids to radiate is due to a key evolutionary innovation shared by all African cichlids. The evidence suggests that speciation rate declines through time as niches get filled up during adaptive radiation: young radiations and early stages of old radiations are characterized by high rates of speciation, whereas at least 0.5 Myr into a radiation speciation becomes a lot less frequent. The number of species in cichlid radiations increases with lake size, supporting the prediction that species diversity increases with habitat heterogeneity, but also with opportunity for isolation by distance. Finally, the data suggest that the propensity to radiate within lakes is a derived property that evolved during the evolutionary history of some African cichlids, and the appearance of which does not coincide with the appearance of proposed key innovations in morphology and life history.</jats:p>",

I review factors that may have facilitated these radiations and compare these with insights from recent work on plant radiations. Work to date suggests that it was a coincidence of ecological opportunity, intrinsic ecological versatility and genomic flexibility, rapidly evolving behavioral mate choice and large amounts of standing genetic variation that permitted these spectacular fish radiations. I propose that spatially orthogonal gradients in the fit of phenotypes to the environment facilitate speciation because they allow colonization of alternative fitness peaks during clinal speciation despite local disruptive selection. Such gradients are manifold in lakes because of the interaction of water depth as an omnipresent third spatial dimension with other fitness‐relevant variables. I introduce a conceptual model of adaptive radiation that integrates these elements and discuss its applicability to, and predictions for, plant radiations.</jats:p>",

Here we use open-source computed microtomography (μCT) scans to generate 3D reconstructions for a majority of apteronotid species and almost all valid genera, and geometric morphometric and phylogenetic analyses to explore patterns of skull evolution. As with most vertebrates, principal component 1 (PC1) summarizes variance from brachycephalic to dolichocephalic morphologies, previously described as heterocephaly, and PC2 summarizes variance from recurved (upturned) to decurved (downturned) snout morphologies, described here as heterorhynchy. Phylomorphospace and traitogram analyses found instances of both convergent and divergent evolution along both of the first two PC axes, as well as a preponderance of clades characterized by morphological stasis or phylogenetic conservatism. Certain phenotypic combinations predominate among species and clades, including elongated-downturned snouts and foreshortened-upturned snouts, while other phenotypic combinations are not observed, including elongated-upturned snouts and foreshortened-downturned snouts. These results highlight the power of 3D geometric morphometrics in the study of craniofacial evolution and indicate developmental or functional constraints in the evolution of craniofacial phenotypes in an ecologically dominant clade of riverine Amazonian fishes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of high resolution, three-dimensional visualization has been receiving growing interest within life sciences, with non-invasive imaging tools becoming more readily accessible. Although initially useful for visualizing mineralized tissues, recent developments are promising for studying soft tissues as well. Especially for micro-CT scanning, several X-ray contrast enhancers are performant in sufficiently contrasting soft tissue organ systems by a different attenuation strength of X-rays. Overall visualization of soft tissue organs has proven to be possible, although the tissue-specific capacities of these enhancers remain unclear. In this study, we tested several contrast agents for their usefulness to discriminate between tissue types and organs, using three model organisms (mouse, zebrafish and Xenopus). Specimens were stained with osmium tetroxide (OsO4), phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) and phosphotungstic acid (PTA), and were scanned using high resolution microtomography. The contrasting potentials between tissue types and organs are described based on volume renderings and virtual sections. In general, PTA and PMA appeared to allow better discrimination. Especially epithelial structures, cell-dense brain regions, liver, lung and blood could be easily distinguished. The PMA yielded the best results, allowing discrimination even at the level of cell layers. Our results show that those staining techniques combined with micro-CT imaging have good potential for use in future research in life sciences.</jats:p>",
