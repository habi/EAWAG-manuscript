### Sample procurement and preparation

The fishes were kept in 75% Ethanol for long-term storage in the EAWAG fish library.
They were delivered to the Institute of Anatomy for micro-CT imaging sorted into several batches by approximately equal length.

[TODO]: # (Can we cite a publication regarding the EAWAG fish library?)
[TODO]: # (Were they transported to Bern as 'Gefahrengut'-Transport? This would be a remarkable little tidbit to add to the manuscript)

### Micro-computed tomographic imaging

All samples were scanned on two of the three available high-resolution micro-CT machines of the Institute of Anatomy of the University of Bern in Switzerland, a SkyScan 1272 and a SkyScan 2214 (both Bruker microCT, Kontich, Belgium).

The fishes were sorted into 'bins' based on their physical size.
We used a custom-made sample-holder to scan each of the fish in our machines.
It was 3D-printed on a Form 2 desktop stereolithography printer (Formlabs, Somerville, Massachusetts, USA) and is freely available online [@https://github.com/TomoGraphics/Hol3Drs/blob/master/STL/EAWAG.Fish.stl] as part of a library of sample holders for tomographic scanning of biomedical samples [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.2587555].
The sample holder was custom-made for this project and is easily parametrized to the different width, height and length classes of the fishes we scanned.

In total, we acquired 340 tomographic scans of 127 different fishes.
All the scanning parameters are collected in a table in the [Supplementary Materials], a generalized rundown is given below.

Since the fishes greatly varied in their length, the voxel sizes of each of the acquired datasets also varies greatly.
We acquired datasets with (isometric) voxel sizes ranging from 3--50 μm.

Depending on the size of the specimen we set the x-ray source voltage to 50--80 kV and---depending on the voltage---to a current between 107 and 200 μA.
Also depending on the size of the fishes, the x-ray spectrum was filtered either by an Aluminum filter of varying thickness (either 0.25, 0.5 or 1 mm) before digitization to projection images or recorded in an unfiltered way.
In total we recorded 8.8 TB of projections images (`*.?if` files) for this project.

All the recorded projection images were subsequently reconstructed into a 3D stack of axial images spanning the regions of interest of each fish.
All the specimens were scanned with their mouths facing downward in the sample holder and rotating along their long axis.
We thus manually aligned each of the reconstructed datasets so that the lateral axis of the fish was horizontal in relation to the x and y direction of the reconstructed slices.
We reconstructed the projection images with NRecon (Version 1.7.4.6, Bruker microCT, Kontich Belgium) with varying ring artifact and beam hardening correction values, depending on each fish (again, all relevant values are listed in the [Supplementary Materials]).
In total, this resulted in 1.4 TB of reconstruction images (`*rec*.png` files).

While performing the work, a subset of the data was always present on the production system, for working with it (see [Preparation for analysis
] below).
A small bash script [@https://github.com/habi/EAWAG/blob/master/rsync-fishes.sh] was used to generate redundant (archival) copies of the raw projection images and copy all the files to a shared network drive on the `Research Storage` infrastructure of the University of Bern, enabling easy collaboration on the data by all authorized persons at the same time.

### Data analysis

We wrote a set of *Jupyter* [@https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/403913] notebooks with *Python* code to work with the images and wrangle the acquired data.
The notebooks were written at the start of the project, to be able to process new scans as soon as they were reconstructed.
Re-runs of the notebook added newly scanned and reconstructed fishes to the analysis, facilitating an efficient quality check of the scans and batched processing of the data.

All analysis notebooks for this work are available online [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.6798632].

#### Preparation for analysis

The main Jupyter notebook for this manuscript dealt with reading all log and image files and preparing images for quality checking and further analysis.
Briefly summarized the below process was implemented.

At first, *all* log files of *all* the data present in the processed forlder were read into a into a *pandas* [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.7093122] dataframe.
This already enabled us to extract the specimen name and scan, since we performed several scans for each specimen, i.e. a low resolution scan with large field of view for the whole head and one or several scans in high resolution focusing on the oral and pharyngeal jaws.
From the log files we extracted the relevant values for double-checking the necessary parameters of each scan.
All relevant values for each scan were also saved into the dataframe and saved out to the aforementioned table in the [Supplementary Materials] at the end of each run of the notebook.

After several 'sanity checks' of the data, we used *Dask* [@dask] to efficiently access the very large total amount of axial reconstructions for this project (in the end amounting to a total of nearly a million single images).
On average, each of the tomographic datasets contains around 3000 slices, so the total amount of data is much too large to keep in memory.
The use of the Dask library facilitated efficient access to the huge amount of data on disk.

At first, we extracted the central view of each of the three axial directions of the datasets (i.e. 'anteroposterior', 'lateral' and 'dorsoventral' view) and either saved those to disk or loaded them from disk if they were already generated in prior runs of the notebook.
The notebook then also generated the maximum intensity projection (MIP) for each of the anatomical planes and either saved them to disk or loaded them from prior runs.

At the end of the notebook we performed a final sanity check on the MIP images.
In this check we examined the mapping of the gray values of the raw projection images to gray values in the reconstructions, i.e. checked that no overexposed pixels are present in the MIP images.
This is an an efficient way for double-checking the gray value mapping, since the MIP images have already been generated in prior steps of the notebook and contain the highest gray values present in all the reconstructed images of each scan.

### Image processing
#### Extraction of oral and pharyngeal jaws, visualization of tomographic data

To extract the oral jaw (OJ) and pharyngeal jaw (PJ) of the fishes, we used [3DSlicer](https://www.slicer.org) (Version 4.11.20210226) [@doi:10.1016/j.mri.2012.05.001] extended with the *SlicerMorph* tools [@doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13669] which aim to help biologists to work with 3D specimen data.
The reconstructed PNG stacks were loaded into *ImageStacks*, depending on their size we reduced the image resolution (i.e. downscaled the images) for this first step.
The three-dimensional volume was rendered via [*VTK GPU Ray Casting*](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/volumerendering.html).
A custom-made volume property (created by Kassandra Ford) was used as an input to view the scans.
Using toggles in the volume rendering, we defined regions of interest (ROIs) for both the OJs and PJs in each specimen..
These ROIs were then extracted in their native resolution from the original dataset for further processing.
Using the gray value thresholding function in 3DSlicers [*Segment Editor*](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmenteditor.html) the teeth in both the oral and pharyngeal jaws were extracted.
We used the *Scissor* and *Island* tools of the Segment Editor to isolate single regions.

Processed regions of interest were exported as NRRD [@https://w.wiki/5mBK] files.
The three-dimensional visualizations of all regions of interest for each specimen were compiled into overview images (see Figure @fig:kat13pptx for an example from the compilation document).
In total we compiled overview of XXX specimens with full head morphology, oral jaw and lower pharyngeal jaw profiles.

#### Principal component analysis of skull landmarks

Current studies are using 3D geometric morphometrics to compare the morphological shape of these scanned cichlids using statistical analysis.
A homologous landmark scheme was produced [@doi:10.1643/i2021016; @doi:10.1093/iob/obac022], and landmarks were placed on each specimen using 3DSlicer.
To examine differences in shape across the species sampled, we performed a Generalized Procrustes Superimposition on the landmark data to remove the effects of location, size, and rotation from the analysis using the *geomorph* package in *R* (Version 4.2.1) with *RStudio* (Version 2022.07.2+576) [@doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13029; @geomorph; @rrpp; @r ;@rstudio].
This process brings all specimens to a common origin, scales the landmarks to a unit centroid size, and rotates specimens to reduce distances between landmark sets.
A principal component analysis was then performed on the superimposed landmark data to visualize the major axes of shape change across sampled species.
We then used phylogenetic information to identify instances of repeated evolution of trophic adaptations in cichlids.

[TODO]: # (How was the PCA performed, also in R?)
