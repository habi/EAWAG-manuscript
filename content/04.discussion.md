## Discussion {.page_break_before}

We acquired high resolution tomographic datasets of a large collection of cichlids (N=133), several tomographic scans were performed for each specimen.
The 372 acquired datasets were imaged over a wide-spanning range of voxel size (3.5--50 Î¼m) permitting both the analysis of finest details we wanted to resolve (i.e. containing only the oral and pharyngeal jaws) and having datasets (N=104) containing the whole head for principle components analysis and extraction of the otoliths.

### Imaging and preparation for analysis

The whole study we presented here spanned a *long* time frame.
It was thus paramount to run the imaging process and the preparation of the tomographic datasets in a batched mode.
The *Jupyter* notebook written to prepare the datasets for quality control and analysis were facilitating a short turnaround time for feedback on single scans and such a batched analysis.

### Otolith extraction

The method to extract the otoliths from the tomographic dataset works robustly for all of the different fish sizes and shapes.
The extraction is robust because it is based on a combination of distinct details of the gray value curve over the different anatomical directions.
The details of the otolith extraction method have been extensively tuned and run in a fully automatic way.
This allows a highly reproducible and unbiased extraction of the otoliths from the tomographic datasets.
This is even the case for one fish which was scanned with still a hook in his mouth, where the otoliths were nonetheless extracted automatically.

Data on such automatically extracted otoliths, like volume and geometric information like eccentricity and moments of inertia is biologically interesting as the otoliths grow with the age of the fish.
One could help estimate the age of wild fishes using a calibration based on the otolith measurements of a fish of known age.
It is worth nothing that estimation of age of tropical fishes is not as simple as for fishes from temperate regions where one can distinguish summer and winter layers within the otolith.

### Outlook

The acquired tomographic datasets are the basis for multiple additional analyses of fish morphology.

The presented method offers an insight and algorithm on how to perform tomographic scans, preview and analyze micro-computer tomographic datasets of a large collection of fish.
The workflow is relying only on free and open-source software and can thus be used and verified independently by any interested reader.
All the *Jupyter* notebook described herein is also freely available online [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.6798632].
