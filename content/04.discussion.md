## Discussion {.page_break_before}

We acquired high resolution tomographic datasets of a large collection of Cichlids.
The acquired datasets were imaged over a wide-spanning range of voxel size (3.5--50 Î¼m) permitting both the analysis of finest details we wanted to resolve (i.e. the structure of the teeth) and having datasets spanning the whole region of interest of the fishes (i.e. the whole head for principle component analysis)

#### Imaging and preparation for analysis

The whole study we presented here spanned a *long* time frame.
It was thus paramount to make the imaging process and preparation of the tomographic datasets able to run in batch-mode.
The Jupyter notebook written to prepare the datasets for quality control and analysis were facilitating a short turnaround time for feedback on single scans.

### Otolith extraction

The method to extract the otoliths of the fishes from the tomographic dataset works robustly for all of the different fish sizes and shapes.
The extraction is robust because it is based on a combination of several intricate details of the gray value curve over the different anatomical directions.
The details of the otolith extraction method have been tuned extensively by us and it now runs completely automatically, allowing for highly reproducible and completely unbiased extraction of the otoliths from the tomographic datasets.

[TODO]: # (Shall we mention the one fish which has a hook in his mouth and the method still works fine?)

Marcel comments:
The extraction of otoliths could actually be biologically really interesting, however, one would have to calibrate this first to be able to extract age estimates then from those extracted otoliths.
I.e. one would have to make a simple growth experiment where you euthanise a number of fish with known age and then CT scan those and correlate the size of the otoliths with their age.
I think that should work like that.
How well that would match growth in the wild, I don't really know...

### Outlook

The acquired tomographic datasets are the basis for several additional analysis of fish morphology.

[TODO]: # (*Very* briefly mention further work from Kassandra and 'another Postdoc' that Ole mentioned.)

The presented method offers an insight and algorithm on how to perform tomographic scans, preview and analyze micro-computer tomographic datasets of a large collection of fishes.
The workflow is relying only on free and open-source software and can thus be used and verified independently by any interested reader.
All the Jupyter notebook described herein is also freely available online [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.6798632].

[TODO]: # (Provide *one* head scan, so that we can link to it in the notebook and write "The notebook can be run in your browser without installing any software via Binder [@doi:10.25080/majora-4af1f417-011] by [clicking a single button](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/habi/eawag/HEAD) in the [README file](https://github.com/habi/EAWAG/blob/master/README.md) of the [project repository](https://github.com/habi/EAWAG) [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.6798632]." or something analogous.)
