### Otolith extraction

The extraction of otoliths could actually be biologically really interesting, however, one would have to calibrate this first to be able to extract age estimates then from those extracted otoliths.
I.e. one would have to make a simple growth experiment where you euthanise a number of fish with known age and then CT scan those and correlate the size of the otoliths with their age.
I think that should work like that.
How well that would match growth in the wild, I don't really know...
