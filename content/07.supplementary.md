### Parameters of tomographic scans of all the fishes

The CSV file [ScanningDetails.csv](https://github.com/habi/EAWAG-manuscript/blob/main/content/data/ScanningDetails.csv) gives a tabular overview of all the (relevant) parameters of all the scans we performed.
This file was generated with the [data processing notebook](https://github.com/habi/EAWAG/blob/master/DataWrangling.ipynb) and contains the data which is read from *all* the log files of *all* the scans we performed.
A copy of each log file is available in a [folder in the data processing repository](https://github.com/habi/EAWAG/tree/master/logfiles).

### Three-dimensional view of *one* of the extracted otoliths

The three-dimensional view of sample 104016 was generated in [the otolith extraction notebook](https://github.com/habi/EAWAG/blob/master/ExtractOtoliths.ipynb) and saved as a [self-contained `HTML` file](https://github.com/habi/EAWAG-manuscript/blob/main/content/data/104016.head.rec.otolith.region.3D.html) with [*K3D-jupyter*](https://github.com/K3D-tools/K3D-jupyter).
A copy of this `HTML` file can be viewed and interacted with through the [GitHub HTML preview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/habi/EAWAG-manuscript/blob/main/content/data/104016.head.rec.otolith.region.3D.html).
