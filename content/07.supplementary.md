### Parameters of tomographic scans of all the fishes

The CSV file [ScanningDetails.csv](https://github.com/habi/EAWAG-manuscript/blob/main/content/data/ScanningDetails.csv) gives a tabular overview of all the (relevant) parameters of all the scans we performed.
This file was generated with the [data processing notebook](https://github.com/habi/EAWAG/blob/master/DataWrangling.ipynb) and contains the data which is read from *all* the log files of *all* the scans we performed.
A copy of each log file is available in a [folder in the data processing repository](https://github.com/habi/EAWAG/tree/master/logfiles).
