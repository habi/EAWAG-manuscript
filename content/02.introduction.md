## Introduction {.page_break_before}

### History and rationale

Cichlid fish in African lakes are powerful model systems for evolutionary biology in speciation and adaptive radiation research [@doi:10.1038/nrg1316; @doi:10.1098/rspb.2006.3539; @doi:10.1002/ece3.7359].
The functional decoupling of their oral and pharyngeal jaws is hypothesized to be a factor in making cichlids unusually versatile in their feeding strategies, allowing them the ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental factors [@doi:10.2307/2412950].
The hypothesis is that the fusion of the lower pharyngeal jaws enables it to become an adaptable tool for processing food, in turn releasing the oral jaws from functional constraint.
The oral jaws no longer need to process prey and can therefore specialize on prey capture.

Even though the evolutionary diversification of cichlid fish radiations in Lake Victoria, East Africa is a well researched topic, it remains a complex system in need of further study [@doi:10.1098/rspb.2006.3539; @doi:10.1111/nph.13450].
We aim to better understand the functional anatomy of the skulls and jaws in these fish in order to test the functional decoupling and other hypotheses about what may facilitate exceptionally high rates of morphological evolution.

The collection of cichlid fish available is extremely valuable, hence a nondestructive imaging method is paramount for studying these samples.
Since microâ€“computed tomography can be regarded as a nondestructive investigation method for biological samples, it is the ideal imaging method for investigating the oral and pharyngeal jaws as well as the skull features of the fish presented in this study [@doi:10.1093/iob/obad008] (N=133).

### Micro-computed tomography

X-ray microtomography is a valuable tool to gain insights into the inner structure of highly diverse samples, namely for specimens related to the biomedical sciences [@doi:10.1186/s12915-020-0753-2].
Microtomographic imaging has been employed as a method of choice to nondestructively assess the morphology of different fish species, large and small [@doi:10.1093/iob/obad008].
For a small overview of analyses which are possible with X-ray microtomographic imaging in relation to fish biology and morphology, see prior work of the authors of this manuscript [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0228333; @doi:10.1093/iob/obac022; @doi:10.1093/iob/obad008] as well as other studies [@https://osf.io/ecmz4].

Depending on the structures of interest to be assessed, biomedical samples are often only tomographically scanned after them being stained with a contrast agent [@doi:10.26496/bjz.2014.63], most often applying contrast agents that contain heavy metals [@10.1089/zeb.2016.1245].
This is done to increase the contrast difference between different structures in the sample.
Due to their inherent contrast difference to the surrounding tissue, the structures of interest we touch upon in this manuscript (teeth and bones, i.e. jaws and skull) are well visualized in the unstained samples.
Thus, staining the samples presented in this manuscript prior to imaging was not necessary.
