### History

Cichlid fish in African lakes are powerful model systems in speciation and adaptive evolutionary radiation research [@doi:10.1038/nrg1316; @doi:10.1098/rspb.2006.3539].
The functional decoupling of their oral and pharyngeal jaws is hypothesized to be a factor in making cichlids unusually versatile in their feeding and allowing them the ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental factors [@doi:10.2307/2412950].
The hypothesis is that the fusion of the lower pharyngeal jaws makes that jaw system a powerful food processing tool, in turn releasing the oral jaws from functional constraint.
The oral jaws no longer need to process prey and can therefore specialize on prey capture.

Even though the evolutionary diversification of cichlid fish radiations in Lake Victoria in Africa is a well-researched issue it remains a complex system in need of further study [@doi:10.1098/rspb.2006.3539; @doi:10.1111/nph.13450].
We aim to better understand the functional anatomy of the skulls and jaws in these fishes in order to test the functional decoupling and other hypotheses about what may facilitate exceptionally high rates of morphological evolution.

The collection of cichlid fish available is extremely valuable, hence a nondestructive imaging method is paramount for studying these samples.
Since microâ€“computed tomography can be regarded as nondestructive method for biological samples, it is the ideal imaging method for investigating the oral and pharyngeal jaws as well as the skull features of the fishes presented in this study [@Ford2023].

### Micro-computed tomography

X-ray microtomography is a valuable tool to gain insights into the inner structure of highly diverse samples, namely for specimens related to research done in the biomedical sciences.
Microtomographic imaging has been employed as a method of choice to nondestructively assess the morphology of different kind of fishes, large and small [@Ford2023].
For a small overview of analyses which are possible with X-ray microtomographic imaging in relation to fish biology and morphology, see prior work of the authors of this manuscript [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0228333; @doi:10.1093/iob/obac022; @Ford2023] as well as other studies [@https://osf.io/ecmz4].

Depending on the structures of interest, biomedical samples are often only tomographically scanned after being stained with a contrast agent, most often employing contrast agents containing heavy metals.
Since the structures of interest for the two studies we touch upon in this manuscript (cichlid teeth and skulls) display large enough contrast to the surrounding tissue we did not stain our samples prior to the tomographic imaging presented here.
